### About Me

print("Hello, World!")

I spent over a decade in a career they make movies about. 

As a seasoned law enforcement professional with over ten years of experience, I have 
honed a diverse skill set that includes analytics, communication, critical thinking, 
decision-making, teamwork, and leadership. My passion for problem-solving 
has enabled me to excel in high-pressure situations, and I continuously 
seek out new challenges that push me beyond my comfort zone.

I'm proud to hold a Bachelor's of Science in Criminal Science, with a 
concentration in Forensics and Technology, from Kennesaw State University. 
During my studies, I successfully completed the rigorous Georgia Public 
Safety Training Center program and became a POST-certified police officer 
with exceptional academic scores.

Leveraging my extensive background in law enforcement, coupled with my 
education and expertise in project management, I have transitioned into 
a pivotal role within the technology industry. As a Technical Project 
Manager, I currently lead SaaS teams in deploying Real Time Crime Center 
(RTCC) Real-Time operations technology within law enforcement agencies 
and SOC2 within the private sector.

In my free time, I **enjoy coding in Python**, developing innovative 
solutions that streamline processes within my professional field. My 
dedication to **learning and professional development** drives me to 
continuously acquire new skills and knowledge, enhancing my value as a 
team player and an asset to any organization.
